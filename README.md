# Document-Classification
Document Classification code written for Introduction to artificial Intelligence course at the University of Wisconsin. Reads in a collection of essays written in both 2016 and 2020 to train with data of the frequency and words used in order to guess whether a passed in essay is more likely to have been written in 2016 or 2020. Utilizes Log prior probability with Laplace smoothing and a naive bayes approach in order to train and keep statistics on word/sentence structures and uses the log prior probability given a label again with laplace smoothing in order to compute the probabilities of a passed in essay being from 2016 or 2020. The program will then predict whether the essay is more likely to be written in 2016 or 2020 and prints this out along with the calculated log probabilities of each year. Code written in python.
